## CSE472-Project1  

Steps to Run Our Code:  

---> To create a JSON file for your Twitter Credentials  
1. Create a folder called Credentials  
2. In the credentials.py file, replace the '*********' with your Twitter API keys  
3. Run credentials.py to create a twitter_credentials.json file  

---> To create the social_network.pkl and id_map.pkl  
1. Run the python-twitter-scraper.py  

---> To create the adjacency matrix and visualise the network graph  
1. Run make_matrix.py  

---> To calculate network measures  
1. Run network_measures.py  

---> Please Ignore the 'Old' folder  

---> Our Id_map.pkl has 614 entries. We did not delete some of the old entries  
    we scraped earlier. However on re-running the code, this will get re-written
